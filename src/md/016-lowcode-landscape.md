There's no doubt that everything runs on software these days.  Often, getting the software right is your edge, your differentiator, or maybe your entire business.  And ss the software landscape continues to grow, it's critical that more people have hands-on experience with the building blocks.  Over the past 3 decades, this has meant hiring and training software specialists to create custom solutions at huge expense.  That was the only way.  But cracks are forming in the walls that keep software development the sole domain of specialists.  In this post, we're going to survey "less-code" tools that can deliver results without expensive custom code.

# Low vs No code
There are a number of articles out there that draw a distiction between "low" and "no" code platforms, as if there's a magic barrier that any code will prevent users from learning a tool.  I find such a distinction to be useless, if not demeaning to people.  I'm hard pressed to think of anyone that hasn't used formulas in Excel.  If you have, congrats!  You develop software.  Now that we've established you as a developer, let's leave the low/no distinction behind and talk about where tools lie on a spectrum of ease-of-use and flexibility.

# User experience/what are you doing?
Unfortunately, I can't say, "learn this tool; it's the best."  What you're doing matters.  

* Are you trying to wrangling a bunch of 3rd party services based on user input?  You may want https://zapier.com/.  
* Need to piece together a bunch of workflows where humans interact and add incremental value?  https://camunda.com/ sounds like what you need.
* Looking for a data-driven UI that runs in a browser?  Maybe https://bubble.io/
* Need a mobile-first experience for jobs on the go?  https://expo.dev/ is a great place to start.

It's also possible that you use multiple platforms for what they're good at.  Bubble, for instance, has a Zappier plugin (https://manual.bubble.io/core-resources/bubble-made-plugins/zapier) so you can use a Bubble UI to leverage the 2000+ Zappier integrations.  Composition comes with a complexity cost, but can unlock incredible power.

### Can you beat Excel?
Before launching into tools, I want us to remember the context.  We're building business applications that meet a need.  We're not building software as a hobby.  Efficiency, maintenance, and usability all matter. Let's always be evaluating, in the back of our minds, "is there an easier way to do this?  Is this the most intuitive thing for a user?  Where is the value-add?"

Grounding our expectations with, "can I do this almost as well/better in Excel?" is a great reminder.  There's a reason it's THE de-facto business tool.  People know how to use excel, it's very good at presenting dense information, and it's flexible.  Yes, you can make it pretty and put it on the web (https://www.airtable.com/, https://workspace.google.com/products/sheets/), but are we creating more value?  

At this point, I'm convinced you need more than a spreadsheet.  So let's look at some tools.

# Mobile
https://expo.dev/ - I've made a few expo apps for general data browsing.  It's pretty good for exposing data to people and presenting views where you can drill into details in a hierarchal manner.  Think conference apps where everyone is seeing the same session content, a menu app, or contacts list.

What it doesn't seem great at is per-user data.  For a conference app, it was really difficult to let a user customize which events they were seeing, or to save their notes (not to be shared with other users).  

But for sheer speed of getting something on your phone, Expo is amazing.  You don't have to side-load an app or push it through an app store to try out.  Expo comes with their own app that is used to download/run your app. You can build/publish your app later, but I was able to get soemthing running on my phone in minutes.
