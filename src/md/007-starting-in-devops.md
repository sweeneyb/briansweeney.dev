Ask 3 people how they define DevOps and you'll get at least 4 answers.  The common thread, though, will be lots of learning, an incredible pace, and the bringing together of multiple technologies.  While you'll certainly never be bored, you may miss the opportunity to be deeply comfortable in a technology before moving on.  Before we dive into the tools you need and things you'll do, let's get on the same page about what DevOps is.

## The "DevOps as a Mindset" view
As the word suggests, DevOps combines development and operations into one team.  The team is responsible for building, deploying, and operating the software.  The idea is that the team is empowered build the software, tools/process to deploy it, and they also "hold the pager" and get calls when things break. This makes the most sense in companies that provide a service via software and less sense for companies that ship software for others to deploy and goes against the traditional groupings where development teams would create the software and "throw it over the wall" to an operations team.  The downside is that the domain for which the team is responsible increases significantly.  Not only do they need to be experts in their product and the language their product is written in, they also need to have knowledge in builds, deployments, operational monitoring, etc.

It's important to recognize this is a cultural shift that affects organization structure.  There are fewer "groups" to handle siloed tasks.  The team is responsible for every aspect of their product.

## The "DevOps as a Job Title" view
DevOps sometimes shows up as a job title, and people on such teams are usually tasked with reducing the technical barriers (and time) between a developer commit and that commit making it into production.  This might involve increasing build automation, automating gates/checks on the way into production, or guiding teams into a reliable deployment mechanism.
